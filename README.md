Hi, I tried to keep it simple, so you just need to go to the source folder and run the command “mvn clean install” to build and run the tests, after that, run the compiled jar file with the command “java -jar target/land-route-0.0.1.jar”.   Now you have the project deployed, the endpoint is the default as requested in the evaluation: http://localhost:8080/routing/{origin}/{destination}.
